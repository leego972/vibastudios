${project.setting ? `- World/setting: ${project.setting}` : ""}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Structure this as a ${actStructure} narrative with approximately ${targetScenes} scenes for a ${duration}-minute film.
2. Each scene must be a SPECIFIC, VIVID, PHOTOGRAPHABLE moment — not a summary or montage description.
3. Describe EXACTLY what the camera sees: the environment details, character positions, facial expressions, body language, spatial relationships, and atmospheric elements.
4. Think like a cinematographer for every single frame:
   - What lens would you choose and why?
   - Where is the key light coming from? What color temperature?
   - What's in the foreground, midground, and background?
   - What colors dominate this frame?
   - What emotion should the audience feel?
   - How does this scene's visual language connect to the scenes before and after it?
5. The visualDescription must be so detailed that a photographer could recreate the exact frame.
6. Vary your shot types — don't use the same camera angle twice in a row.
7. Build visual tension through the narrative arc — the visual intensity should escalate toward the climax.
8. Every scene must serve both the narrative AND the visual storytelling.
